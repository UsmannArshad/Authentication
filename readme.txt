Postman:
Postman is an application used for API testing. It is an HTTP client that tests HTTP requests, utilizing a graphical user interface, through which we obtain different types of responses that need to be subsequently validated
We can test our db without client or react app using Postman.

=>After making schema and model we will make a addUser route for adding new user
in mongodb.Now to test it we will go to postman change the action method to post
change url to 127.0.0.1/api/addUser.User will be posted to db.
